    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      After receiving my M.Eng., I have become a CFD/CAE software engineer.
      With 3-year experience in software development, gradually, I'm mastering both the programming languages and the workflow of software development.
      I mainly program in C/C++/CUDA, sometimes script in Python and NodeJs. I have experience in CFD software architect, framework design and implementation, numerical methods, computational geometry, CUDA acceleration and general algorithms.
      I have a hard-working, listening, and cooperating personality, and also have experiences in guiding new colleagues and managing a 3-people team.
      I'm willing to continue my career in the field of general software engineering.
